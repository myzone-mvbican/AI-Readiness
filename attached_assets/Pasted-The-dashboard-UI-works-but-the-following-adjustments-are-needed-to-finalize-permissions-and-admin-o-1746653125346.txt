The dashboard UI works, but the following adjustments are needed to finalize permissions and admin-only functionality:

🛠 1. Fix Admin Badge Visibility
Currently, all users see the (Admin) badge in the team dropdown, even if they are not admins.

Fix this by:

Checking if the user is actually part of that team as an admin, not just globally marked admin.

Only show the (Admin) badge next to teams where the user has an admin role.

➕ 2. Restrict Team Creation
Only users who are part of at least one admin team should see and be able to click the “Create Team” option in the dropdown.

If the user is not an admin of any team, hide or disable the "Create Team" option entirely.

🔒 3. Disable Team Switcher for Solo Team Users
If a user is part of only one team, disable the dropdown entirely (or make it non-interactive).

Optional: show it as static text instead of a button, for clarity.

🎨 4. Update Team Role Icons
Adjust the icons for Client and Admin team roles:

Use a unique icon for each:

Admin: something like a shield (ShieldCheckIcon from Lucide or similar)

Client: something like a briefcase, building, or user icon

Apply icons only inside the dropdown item, not globally across the sidebar.

📄 5. Add Admin-Only Surveys Route and Menu
Add a new sidebar menu item labeled Surveys

Route: /dashboard/surveys

Only visible if the selected team has role = admin and the user is a member of it.

The route page (/dashboard/surveys) should:

Reuse the dashboard layout

Display placeholder/dummy content like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
This is the Surveys page for administrators.
More functionality coming soon.
🔒 Do Not:
Do not display or allow interaction with teams or routes where the user has no access.

Do not change visual layout or component positioning.

Do not alter team switching logic outside of permission and visual guardrails.

✅ Ensure that all permissions are enforced based on:

Logged-in user’s email + role (from backend/JWT),

The role of the currently selected team.
