I want to build a survey results page similar to the visual reference (completion screen with a radar chart and score summary).

📊 Page Requirements
Use shadcn/ui components wherever applicable (Cards, Buttons, Alerts, etc.).

🧱 Layout Structure:
Use a centered layout within a Card or Container from shadcn.

Add a heading:
Survey Complete!

Show the overall score:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Your AI Readiness Score: 60%
Use large blue text for the score.

🕸️ Radar Chart:
Render a radar chart using a charting library (e.g., recharts, chart.js, or nivo).

Axes/metrics should include:

Strategy & Vision

Culture & Change-Readiness

Skills & Literacy

Data & Information

Technology & Integration

Governance & Risk

Implementation

Plot the user’s score per category.

Title: Readiness Breakdown

⚠️ Error Message (Conditional)
If the PDF generation fails, show an Alert from shadcn with:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
There was an error generating your report. Please try again later.
Style it as variant="destructive" inside a Card.

📄 Detailed Recommendations
Below the chart, render recommendations as a list of expandable or stylized Card or Accordion components:

For each category, show:

Title: (e.g., Skills & Literacy)

Summary: (1–2 lines of feedback)

Badge for performance level (e.g., Medium: 3.0 / 5) using Badge with yellow variant.

You can use dummy recommendation text like:

“Some departments show good AI literacy but gaps exist. Implement skills assessment and a more comprehensive learning program.”

🎯 Action Buttons
Add at the bottom:

Back to Home button (links to /dashboard)

Retake Survey button (links to /dashboard/surveys/new)

Download PDF (button, no actual logic yet)

Share Results (optional, dummy button)

Use Button from shadcn and align buttons horizontally with spacing.

🛑 Do Not:
Do not generate the form itself — only render the results.

Do not integrate real chart data — mock values are fine.

Do not build the PDF logic — placeholder button only.

The page should be fully responsive, styled with Tailwind + shadcn/ui, and visually consistent with the existing dashboard layout.
