I'm building a benchmark comparison system for quarterly assessments using React, Node/Express, and a DB (Postgres or equivalent). I need to:

Aggregate scores by category per industry and quarter

Compare user/team scores to industry averages

Display results in a chart widget on /dashboard/

I‚Äôm also applying constraints for reliability and growth. Here's what needs to be built:

üß† 1. Backend Model: SurveyStats
Create a table:

ts
Copy
Edit
SurveyStats {
  id: string
  industry: string | "global"
  category: string // e.g., "Strategy"
  quarter: string  // e.g., "2025-Q2"
  surveyTemplateId: string
  averageScore: number
  completedCount: number
  segmentKey?: string // e.g., "industry|region" or null
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
This allows fast lookups and filtered aggregation by quarter, industry, and segment.

üîÅ 2. Aggregation Logic (recalculateSurveyStats())
Create a service function or cron job that:

Fetches all completed assessments with completedOn inside the current or target quarter

Groups by:

industry

category

surveyTemplateId

Calculates:

Average score per category

Number of completed assessments

Only includes industries with ‚â• 5 assessments

For those that don‚Äôt meet threshold ‚Üí fallback to "global"

Applies filters:

Ignore dummy/test users

Exclude assessments where:

All scores are the same (e.g., 10 identical answers)

Or <50% of questions were answered

Upserts into SurveyStats

Schedule this weekly via cron (or after X new completions).

üîê 3. Public API Route: /api/surveys/benchmark/:id
Returns comparison-ready data:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "quarter": "2025-Q2",
  "surveyTemplateId": "19",
  "industry": "Healthcare",
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Strategy",
      "userScore": 6.2,
      "industryAverage": 5.4,
      "globalAverage": 5.9
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Logic:

Look up assessment

Determine user‚Äôs industry and quarter

Pull matching SurveyStats

Include fallback to global averages if needed

üìä 4. Frontend Widget on /dashboard/: Score vs. Industry Average
Use a Card from shadcn/ui to wrap the chart component.

Placement:
On /dashboard/ main route

Show this widget for logged-in users with at least one completed assessment

Chart:
Use recharts or from shadcn, wrapped in a Card:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Your AI Readiness vs Industry Benchmarks</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent className="h-[300px]">
    <ResponsiveBar
      data={data}
      keys={['userScore', 'industryAverage']}
      indexBy="name"
      colors={['#3b82f6', '#9ca3af']}
      layout="vertical"
    />
  </CardContent>
</Card>
Optional:
Show a subtitle: "Based on 158 Healthcare submissions in Q2 2025"

Show badge or label fallback if "global" is used instead of industry

üß† 5. Optional Enhancements (structure support now)
Feature	Add to schema?	Why?
Region / Org Size	segmentKey field	For future segmentation
stdDev, median	Extend stats calc	Show score distribution
Delta to previous Q	previousScore prop	For showing progress trends

‚úÖ Final Deliverables
Backend
 SurveyStats table

 Aggregation cron job (recalculateSurveyStats)

 Quality filters: dummy user, same scores, too few answers

 Min 5 responses per industry to publish

 Global fallback

 API: GET /api/benchmark/:assessmentId

Frontend
 Chart widget on /dashboard/ route

 Bar chart: category vs industry

 Fallback message if no industry benchmark

 Use shadcn/ui Card components
