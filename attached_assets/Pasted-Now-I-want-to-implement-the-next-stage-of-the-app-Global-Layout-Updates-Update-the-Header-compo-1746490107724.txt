Now I want to implement the next stage of the app:

üîß Global Layout Updates
Update the Header component:

Add a placeholder logo (/logo.svg).

Make the header sticky at the top of the page.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive layout.

Update the Footer:

Simplify it to include only:
¬© 2025 MyZone AI. All rights reserved.

Make "MyZone AI" a link to https://myzone.ai.

Use minimal Tailwind styling.

üè† Homepage Design
Create a visually appealing Hero Section on the homepage with the following content:

Headline:
MyZone AI Readiness Survey

Subtext:
Welcome! This AI Readiness Assessment should be completed quarterly as one of your foundational AI KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. You can save your results as a PDF or compare with industry benchmarks.

Style it using Tailwind CSS for clean typography and spacing.

Make it responsive and modern-looking.

üîê Login Functionality
Provide two login options:

Option 1: Google Sign-In
Use @react-oauth/google or similar package for Google auth.

Display a "Sign in with Google" button.

After successful login, redirect user to /survey.

Option 2: Custom Login Form
Use react-hook-form with zod schema validation.

Fields:

Name (text)

Email (email)

Company (text)

Number of employees (select):
Options: 1-9, 10-49, 50-149, 150-499, 500-999, 1000+

Industry (select with 10 options):

Technology / Software

Healthcare

Education

Finance

Manufacturing

Retail

Transportation

Energy

Government

Media / Entertainment

Validate all fields using zod.

On successful form submission, redirect to /survey.

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details
Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

Include .scss styles if custom styles are required beyond Tailwind.

Place all components and logic in appropriate folders based on standard React + Vite project structure (e.g., components/, pages/, hooks/, etc.).

Include comments for any config, import, or logic that might not be obvious.

Ensure everything is mobile-friendly and responsive.
