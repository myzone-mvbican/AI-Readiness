Andrej
Hello?
Mike Schwarz
Good morning. Good evening.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Hey.
Andrej
Hi, hi.
Mike Schwarz
Oh, myâ€¦ No worries, let me hit record and we'll get started.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Let me join, because my camera has issues again.
Mike Schwarz
Welcome to the first everâ€¦ lies on AI readiness assessments slash flight navigator, whatever we call this thing. weeklyâ€¦ L10 strategy meeting, orâ€¦ Monday, October 20th. 2025. Um, big update for BCAN is that we've got. Andre, for the next month, who's going to be helping us with. strategy, making sure we've got the right architecture here for. V2, and beyond. And the goal of this meeting? is to make sure we have. solid rhythm. Maybe somebody could mute themselves, quite a bit of background noise there.

ðŸŽ¯
Decision
Andrej
Hi, Iâ€™m transcribing this call with my Tactiq AI Extension: https://tactiq.io/r/transcribing
Mike Schwarz
Um, the goal of this meeting isâ€¦ to make sure we have a clear roadmap.

ðŸŽ¯
Decision
That to be kind, you have all the resources that you need. Um, I think in these early stages, the most important part here will be just really solidifying.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
strategy, framework, architecture, what V1, V2, V3 looks like. And me, selfishly, what I want to get out of this isâ€¦ a plan that I can take to investors and say, what kind of capital do we need? If any, to bring this thing to market and do it proper. So that's the goal. Umâ€¦ Vecan. How are things going with you?

ðŸŽ¯
Decision
Bican Marian Valeriu
Still learning with, uhâ€¦ This AIâ€¦ enterprise-level software. I've built a bunch of stuff. I mean, I was testing a bunch of stuff. on my own personal project. Which is also already bleed. Soâ€¦ The code you see on the AI readiness, it'sâ€¦ It'sâ€¦ how should I say? It's the first itineration of ever trying to build something at this scale. And the other one, it's much, much, much better in terms of architecture. Soâ€¦ I've learned a lot on that stuff.
Mike Schwarz
Awesome, and that's what I was bringing Andre up to speed on where you were at, really, the last couple months has just beenâ€¦ deep on learning agentic development and enterprise frameworks and testing and working throughâ€¦ he's got a couple test projects. Um, and the goalâ€¦ I think last time we spoke, Bikan, you thought you were anotherâ€¦ sort of a couple months away from feeling fully comfortable with these things, and that you're deep into.

ðŸŽ¯
Decision
training. Is that still the rightâ€¦ Summary?

ðŸ’¡
Callout
Bican Marian Valeriu
Yeah, I mean, I still need to build something. more, how should I say, somethingâ€¦ or this scale, to actually see it live, you know. And then I can be confident. Right now, I would then say I am, soâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah. And, uh, yeah, hopefully Andre can help us with that. So, you guys have allâ€¦ read throughâ€¦ the vision document per Flight Navigator, correct?
Bican Marian Valeriu
Yeah.
Andrej
Yep.
Mike Schwarz
Um, so Andre, what are your thoughts onâ€¦ how do weâ€¦ how do we best approach this? Doesâ€¦ is that document communicate enough of what. Where I think the opportunity is, and you can see I added some things in there since our last call, Andre, I realize I think we need 3 layers. ofâ€¦ I'm not saying this is all version 1, butâ€¦ Um, I think there needs to beâ€¦ assessments for the individual. assessments for the department and assessments for the company. I think there needs to be a company account that anchors that. all together. I like Andre's thoughts ofâ€¦ In general, like, let's MVP this thing, get it to market in its most simplest form, and maybe we startâ€¦ with just individual exams. for one industry. You know, maybe it'sâ€¦ marketing agency.
marketing people, and that's where we go out and. But we need to think, like, the architecture forâ€¦ Okay, once we've got marketing agencies, now we want to add law firms, now we want to add individual, you know, likeâ€¦ different departments and progress from there, butâ€¦ I think the full vision, like, what I know I would want as aâ€¦ CEO, is I would want to see data. from all layers, all three layers would be critical. And I think the most importantâ€¦ To start with, if I had to guess. isâ€¦ I don't know, they're all pretty important, but probably down to the individual level, so I could just see how myâ€¦ how ready my team is.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
I think that, you know, based onâ€¦ I agree with you, Andre, from our last chat. If I had to choose between, like, a high-level 40-point question on readiness assessment versus, like. how ready is my team, and do I need to look at letting some people go and bringing in some new people? I think that's a more timely decision. Butâ€¦
Andrej
Hmm. How do you resolve? You know, last time we spoke about it, I presented a problem. of this top-down approach, how do you resolve that problem in terms of. I mean, you give your people. test, they're gonnaâ€¦ are they going to answer truthfully? Are they going to answer what they think is best. for their result, you know? Like, if you ask him a question. how Gentic are you, like, it's a simplification, obviously, but uhâ€¦ Uh, you know, a lot of, like, I have 20 questions for software developers in my test that I've created, and. Some are obvious in terms of. I went through them with one developer, and in some cases, I was like. Are you really, like, you know, some are obvious in terms of.
you know, new version comes along ofâ€¦ new ChatGPT comes along. Ru.
Bican Marian Valeriu
what should you answer?
Andrej
curious about the new version and looking into how it can improve your workflow, or B. Uh, you know, holding on until other people. start raving about it for a few months, and then, you know. or C, not even looking at it at all, likeâ€¦ whoever's your employee is gonna be like, yeah, I'm just gonna push A, becauseâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Well, I think we've solved that the wayâ€¦ uh, regular exams. solve that. You don't, you know, when I did my psychology degree, they don't come along and say, like. How good are you at psychology? A to B. It's like, no, they ask specific questions about a theorem and a principle, and. And so, like, in that example, if something new came out with GPT-5 in the last month, we would update the curriculum. to ask those specific questions, and then based on their answers, we would know whether or not they've stayed up to date with things.
Those are my thoughts, but yeah, the questionâ€¦
Andrej
Yeah, that's also something that can be game. But look, we can skip that entire, you know, topic.
Mike Schwarz
It could be gamed with AI, yeah, butâ€¦ the way thatâ€¦
Andrej
Exactly. Like, why would I not just, like, tell ChatGPT, hey, I want to get the highest possible score. on this assessment, uh, here's the question, what should I say, you know?
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, there'sâ€¦ and the way that, uh, testing companies get around the gaming is, so we had a license for Test Gorilla for years. what they do is they, umâ€¦ I mean, I wouldn't worry about it in version 1. That's version 2.3 problem, if people are gonna cheat and use AI to cheat. If they're using AI to cheat, that's probably not that bad of a thing, because they're learning while they're cheating, you know what I mean? But, uh, what we could do is, umâ€¦ Like, Tuscarilla would just take a random picture to make sure it was them.
Uh, and then two, is you could, uh, force them toâ€¦ maybe do the test through a specific browser? And that browser hasâ€¦ functionality to monitor what's going on in their computer. Um. Or maybe, like, it should be timed? Uh, there should beâ€¦ they could have a camera taking photos. Logging it, and there must be some way to keep track of. Um, API connections and tokens andâ€¦ Uh, something like that. With these testing tools. But, look, if peopleâ€¦ game it, I don't think that's somethingâ€¦ we need to worry about for V1.
I think that's a V2 problem to solve, and technology, I think, could solve it. Like, we just, like, what do the major testing companies do?
Andrej
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, umâ€¦ So, so look, I mean, the document hasâ€¦ featuresâ€¦ versions and features in there, right? So I think you've outlined specifically, in V1, you're calling it prototype for seed Readiness Engine. There are certain things that are done, certain things that are new.
as the document states, we can goâ€¦ can we share the screen and go through the document, or what's the bestâ€¦ way to do this now.
Mike Schwarz
Sure. Yeah.
Andrej
I just want to talk specifically about, you know, what our next 17 different things that need to be. Created.
Mike Schwarz
Well, I thinkâ€¦ I thinkâ€¦ My thoughts are that, one, we need to nail the vision, but two. And I guess that's probably the most important thing. I guess, nailing the vision, because then, yeah, we can't go and look at the architecture until we figure out.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
what the vision is, is that that's what you're getting at, right, Andre?
Andrej
Well, no, where I'm coming from is you already have a specific vision and a strategy that you want to implement, if I'm not mistaken, right? You already have thought about this very, very, very deeply, like, 100 times more than I have, and have aâ€¦ have come.
Mike Schwarz
Umâ€¦
Andrej
with the specific vision and a plan, and you know a lot of things that are indisputable. Like, you need a multi-tenancy thing where you want to, you know, bring it into multiple markets and be able to white-label it. There are certain things that you absolutely need to have, like the ability to version questions. So you can have, uh, you know. let's say, questions that are specific to marketers, and then you can upgrade those questions into a version. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, whatever else, as you change the curriculum slightly. you know, you want the company account, you want invites into the company, you want to have company-level.
department level and personal level questions, like, all of those, I'm assuming you are clear on, right?
Mike Schwarz
Yeah. Yeah, oh yeah.
Andrej
Now, I'm not sure, like, when you say we should nail the strategy, what are the ambiguities that youâ€¦ I can help you with? figuring out, in terms of what are, like, all of thisâ€¦ the direction of the product seems like you areâ€¦ Clear width.
Mike Schwarz
Well, theyâ€¦ Well, the oneâ€¦ the oneâ€¦ big change. I thought I was clear onâ€¦ architectural strategy. But after our last meeting, suddenly I realized we needed the three layers. Like, what me and Bikan were thinking about before is that we would have. the company-wide ones, and then we would create departmental-specific ones. That was already in the plan, and BCAN built that so that we could add additional. surveys, and we can make them timed, like, this is Q1, and this is Q2, and get people to come back, but we hadn't thought of, like, that company account, and then doing the individual assessments. We were doing the individual assessments separately through different software with Jeanette and Kajabi.
And then after talking with you, that was the third layer that I brought in. So, I wanted to sort of go through it and make sure I'm not missing any big opportunities. Um, and then also deciding where those features go into Buck version 1, 2, or 3. Um, so that we get an MVP out. And does the MVP start with, like, the bottom up or top-down? Like, right now, we already have the top-down built.
So maybe that's where we start, because it's already built. Um, but do we have the architecture in place to handle all three layers? that sort of thing. But I'm pretty solid in my mind of, you know, it's gonna beâ€¦ there's a team account. There's a company account that's going to be either free or paid, and with a paid account, you're going to get a whole bunch of additional features. And, umâ€¦ so yeah, in my mind, I feel 100% clear on where this product will evolve to, but I do want to go out with an MVP approach and then learn based on feedback and evolve rapidly.
Andrej
I would say it reallyâ€¦ Okay.
Mike Schwarz
So, do you think it makes sense to go through the, uh, document together, sort of section by section, and just sort of make clearâ€¦ make sure we're clear onâ€¦ each of these ideas and where they fit in, sort of V123, orâ€¦ What do you think?
Andrej
No, I think it makes sense to outline what, you know, what's theâ€¦ even just articulating and communicating what is in your vision the MVP line, like, you know, you've been speaking to so many different CEOs and business owners and operators that. I guess you have a pulse on that, andâ€¦ Uh, if you can articulate it and say, look, you know, the MVP of this, which you would be comfortable. sharing, let's say, if you are on a stage or in front of 100 different people. would need to have, at minimum, and this is where you would let us know, like, you know, we need to have at minimum, let's say.
admin account, which can invite users, uhâ€¦ you know, do weâ€¦ do you think that as an MVP, we need to have individual assessments or not? Um, maybe those individual assessments can be broken down as well, and the individual assessment can be. Generally, our readiness assessment, which is already, you know, a big leap forward, but then. specific role-based ones can be something like version 2. or post-MVP launch. Um, you know, what kind of an output needs to be there.
what kind ofâ€¦ what kind of supporting materials, like, what's theâ€¦ what doâ€¦ likeâ€¦ what do people see when they go through, like, what does a CEO see as aâ€¦ in their dashboard that allows them to make decisions and propel the organization forward. Is thereâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah.
Andrej
uh, you know, how far along. is the PDF and the report versus where it needs to be before we launch. Or do weâ€¦ do we start charging day one? Or is it completely free? Um, if we do start charging day one, what are the plans and payment options? We're using Stripe, okay, well. you know, what's theâ€¦ is it subscription-based? Is it, you knowâ€¦ seed-based and stuff like that, like, just painting a high-level picture would be very helpful.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, got it. Okay, so justâ€¦ justâ€¦ whatâ€¦ and so in summary, like, whatâ€¦ what are the critical things that we need that are preventing us from, like.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
marketing this thing right now. I'll tellâ€¦ yeah, so Iâ€¦ my thoughts here is that we go with the free version.
Andrej
Exactly. Yeah.
Mike Schwarz
to start, um, because I want to collect as much data as possible, and feedback, and then. upsell people later? Once they're hooked. Umâ€¦ So that's the first thing. The only thing that I think we need right now.
Andrej
Okay.
Mike Schwarz
That prevents me fromâ€¦ like, I'm already marketing it. Um, but here, I'm gonna, I'm gonna list these down, and we'll get them in the transcript, but feel free to write them down. But one. is we need some sort of analytics package. that allows us to see. conversion and retention rates. That'll be really important for assessing the health of.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
Andrej
And that's an admin level, I assume, right?
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, and I don't know if that could beâ€¦ just Google Analytics set up properly, but, you know, we're gonna have to figure out what are our KPIs, how do we measure success before we startâ€¦ you know, because we're going toâ€¦ it's kind of like launching a video game, like, we're gonna spend a little bit of money. launching this, and thenâ€¦ we need to see how many people convert, what the cost is, the retention, how many people make it to what stages, and how many complete, and.
Andrej
Yeah.
Mike Schwarz
Um, a way to assess their feedback andâ€¦ That is going to be important before we scale marketing.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
So, I justâ€¦ I would bookmark that as just analytics package.
Andrej
Yeah, okay.
Mike Schwarz
Um, two, I would say the most important thing, like, the real value that they get for all of their work is the output, it's the PDF, it's the report, andâ€¦ the report right now isâ€¦ I believe it's a one-shot prompt.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
Andrej
Okay.
Mike Schwarz
And the vision for it was, like, what, umâ€¦ what BCAN is working on for Lux Homes. It's a complex multi-chain prompt where, you know, chapter one is. uh, strategies, chapter 2 is tools. Chapter 3 is whatever, andâ€¦ there's a, you know, 5-page detailed report, fully customized based on their answers for each. chapter, and that it could include.
Andrej
Is thereâ€¦ is there even a report right now? When I click on download PDF, it goes to, uhâ€¦ He just tries to download a JSON file.
Mike Schwarz
Unless it's broken, yeah, there's a PDF you can download right now, and the PDF just shows. like, a summary ofâ€¦ what you said this time, what you said last time, like a short paragraph, a score, and the top 3 rocks, and then the next section. It'sâ€¦ It's about 1 tenth or less, maybe 1 20th of what I envision it would be.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
So, like, with Luxe Quality Homes. It's like a multi-page PDF with, like, cover, about us. descriptions, like, our framework, why it's important. There's a whole intro section, and that's content, like the wrapper, the PDF wrapper that's gotta be beautiful.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
Then we go into Chapter 1, Strategy. This is why it's one of the pillars. These are the 8 questions we asked you. These are the best practices. This is what you said. This is what it means for you, and then there's a customized chapter, and then these are the. topâ€¦ these are all of the things that you need to work on, and these are the top. this is a top one, this is, like, ranked in order of priority, and then we closed that chapter, we go to the next chapter. There'd be 8 different chapters in that book. And most importantly, like, that's the value that peopleâ€¦ why do they invest all this time? Because they want that report. Right now, it's a 1, and we can take that to a 50 pretty quick.
Um, but from us, the way we monetize.
Andrej
is there data we can pull from, in terms of, do you already have? some sort of written document that saysâ€¦ where we could, you know.
Mike Schwarz
Yes. Yes.
Andrej
construct these multi-step, uhâ€¦ prompts to generate this PDF.
Mike Schwarz
Yes, uh, so I have aâ€¦ I have a book, and each chapter of the book, but I couldâ€¦ I can very quickly generate a rough draft versions of what we need just by blabbering into a microphone for 5 minutes for each chapter. That's enough to get us started. Um, and as weâ€¦ but we need the admin panel. So that we can easily update. the knowledge base for each chapter.
Andrej
Okay.
Mike Schwarz
with best practices. So, I canâ€¦ I canâ€¦
Andrej
Well, yeah, you would beâ€¦ Ideally, we give you the ability to edit prompts. for each part of the book generation.
Mike Schwarz
I was thinking that prompts would probably say the same, but theâ€¦ The prompts are, umâ€¦ Prompting a slice ofâ€¦ data that would probably be in a vector database, which would be that the knowledge base for each chapter.
Andrej
You don't want the vector database for this. That'sâ€¦ that's the wrong thing to do it, becauseâ€¦ The reason why you implement the vector database is because you need dynamically. You need to dynamically pull data. differently each time. In this case, you don't need to do that. You need every timeâ€¦ entire chapter into the prompt, entire chapter into the prompt, and say, this is an example of the output that we're looking for, now customize it based on this company and their answers.
Mike Schwarz
Oh, we put the entire thing in the prompt. It'll fit in the context? Okay. Okay, yeah. So, just an, yeah, an admin panel where I can edit the prompt, and there should be sections of the prompt that are sort of dynamically built, like, this is the knowledge base for.
Andrej
Andâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Pillar 1, this is a knowledge base for Pillar 2, and then an admin panel where I can edit that, and thenâ€¦ that, so I think that's pretty critical for launch. Um, we could have Mario sort of mock up. what the final output looks like, including the cover and the intro and about us, andâ€¦ all that, and then there's an admin panel where I edit all those props and the content for each section. Andâ€¦ and, oh yeah, so the most important part, how we monetize this, is referrals. Like, the first.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
set of referrals is to MyZone AI. So, when they come along, and there's under one section for resources. And we realize they don't have the resources that we need, then the recommendation would be that you definitely need to. have a fractional CALO, somebody like Mike from MyZone. you know, click here to book an appointment. And it has, like, a Calendly link right there in the report. As an example, or wherever we find those. those issues. Or if it's in a marketing report and their team is still typing, and it's like, you guys need to sign up for Whisper Flow, or Super Whisper, here's two links and affiliate codes.
Andrej
Okay.
Mike Schwarz
you know, with QR codes, they can scan, or links with affiliate codes embedded. Um, so we need to be able toâ€¦ dynamically insert. uh, promotionalâ€¦ copy propaganda in there. That's howâ€¦ that's how we're gonna monetize. So that's, like, version 1.1. It doesn't have to be there for launch, but that'sâ€¦ probablyâ€¦ Yeah.
Andrej
propaganda. Okay. That's easy, that should be there for launch, that's super easy. I would say that, in just a second, I have toâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. Uh, and Beacon, I'm thinking for, yeah, maybe version 1 launch, we're just promoting my zone. Like, wherever they clearly need us and we can help. Then, in that chapter, it says, this is why you need MyZone, and this is how we can help you. Click here to book a call, and we have maybe, like, 3 to 5 call to actions within a. 50-page PDF report, that's fine. Version two of that, we would have, like, an adâ€¦ so version 1 would be just promoting ourselves throughout that final output, version.
Andrej
I'm back.
Mike Schwarz
1.1 would be some sort of admin panel where we can feature clients and partners and affiliates in different sections, and then we can have in the prompt, it says, if they say no to this question, then we promote this tool with this affiliate link, and we can say things like this. So, some sort of, uh, propaganda builder admin panel? On the back, that'sâ€¦
Andrej
Okay, at this stage, we're not yet talking about white label, right? So this is where we launch, you know, a fly director, it's an MVP, it's only used by MyZone. Questions are pretty much general. You go on stage, you promote it, you have a bunch of people spreading it out, and it's basically allowing the company at this point to get a general sense of. where they're at, it's not super specific to an industry yet, andâ€¦ And you'reâ€¦ testing the waters and, you know, with that.
Mike Schwarz
Correct. Yeah, collecting early feedback, we're getting a prototype, we're raising some money, we're building the bigger vision.
Andrej
Okay.
Mike Schwarz
And then we're gonna go for the more complex one later. We already have a white label version for one client who's a managed service provider, Kieran. But for that, it's just simple. It's a copy-paste the code, and keep that client happy until we move to, like, aâ€¦ multi-tenant SaaS with white-label features built in version 3. Yeah. So yeah, I think those are the main things that we need. Uh, the final output needs to beâ€¦ kick ass, the ability for me to edit the prompts and insert that knowledge. for each of those sections, the ability toâ€¦ within those prompts, I could promote MyZone AI and include Calendly links for certain situations. And then, shortly thereafter, the ability to promote. clients, affiliates, partners with affiliate links, uh, based on answers to those.
specific questions, and I think we're ready to goâ€¦ with the first, you know, let's spend five grand on meta ads. sign up a bunch of people, collect their first round of data, and then figure out. what comes next. Umâ€¦ Is that enough info for B1â€¦ launchâ€¦ it's already live, but I mean, V1 marketing launch requirements. Is that clear, or do you guys think there's anything else missing, especially BCAN? Like.
you've had your head wrapped around this for a while. Do you think there's anything else critical that we need to work on before I should start? spending money on ads to collect that. We're not even spending money in ads, what am I talking about? I'll be doing drip email to all my CEO friends from EO. And get, you know, like, 100 CEOs to sign up and test it out for us.
Bican Marian Valeriu
And after all of this learning stuff with AI, to be honest, I'm not confident with the architecture of Quarant, uh, AI readiness. it'sâ€¦ it's mostly, likeâ€¦ draft version, then, rather than something that it should be production-ready.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, and that's why we've got you in training, and that's why we've got Andre here to review that, but I think just looking at the business. use case for V1. Is there anything else that we want business-wise? Uh, how it gets implemented on the back end, and do we need to refactor, or restructure, or rebuild? is a second question, butâ€¦ From what I said there, like, getting that multi-page report. Um. Andâ€¦ oh, yeah, sorry, I just thought of one more thing. The, umâ€¦ it's a smaller request, but we have NAIC industry codes. There's, like. over 10,000 of these codes that you can be part of. The benchmarking. Uh, right now is either we have your code, and there's a benchmark data, or it reverts to global.
Uh, for that one, I would say it's a V1 requirement that itâ€¦ it is in layers, so if you're, say, a social media marketing agency, and there's no other social media marketing agencies that have submitted, we don't have benchmark data. It doesn't revert to global, it goes up one level and looks at marketing agencies. as the benchmark. that was a missing feature for, I think, this launch. Because otherwise, the benchmarking isâ€¦ going to beâ€¦ pretty useless, because there's so many different industries, and we want to make sure it's, like, statistically significant, at least 3 to 5 companies have responded in your category, or we go up a level.
Andrej
So one thing that's extremely confusing is that you're basically basing theâ€¦ companyâ€¦ count based on the actual code of the industry. which there's, like, a bunch of them, right? So, like, you know.
Mike Schwarz
Mm-hmm.
Andrej
nursery and tree production is 1114 to 1. And so on. Uh, mushroom production, or whatever.
Mike Schwarz
Yep.
Andrej
Umâ€¦ wouldn't you want toâ€¦ I understand the appeal of having this, like, super standardized, but wouldn't you want to have that. more UI-friendly, like, if I'm a software development company, just tell me, just let me pick up a softwareâ€¦ you know, if I'm a marketing agency.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, I think they can just type in software development, and it willâ€¦ you can search by name, or you can enter in your code, or you can even punch in your URL. And it will tell you what your code is by analyzing your website. So I think it has all three options.
Andrej
Yeah. the question is more, do we need themâ€¦ do we need toâ€¦ categorize them into a code. And also, what ifâ€¦ what if theyâ€¦ what if they, umâ€¦ What if they're a part of multiple. industries. Like, what would you choose as a code for Marison AI? Because you're, you know, a consulting agency, you're robotic automation agency, you're a marketing agency, your design agency, or web development agency.
Mike Schwarz
I, you know, you'd just have to pick one, I guess. I would put us down as, like, an AI consulting agency.
Andrej
Okay. Alright, if you're fine with that, that's fine.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, they gotta pick one code. Yeah, I think that's fine, and I think they have the ability to change their code if they want to seeâ€¦ You know, good point there. Like, if they could haveâ€¦ if the only reason we have benchmark, we could say, what is your primary. code. Um, but then if you could give them, like, on a paid plan for version 2, that they could add. secondary codes that they want to compare against. then they could choose up to 3 additional codes. Uh, for benchmarking. So that theyâ€¦ or they can just have unlimited benchâ€¦ they could change their benchmarks. Like, right now, it couldâ€¦ it shows you yours or global. That's it.
And for the paid plan, it's like you could drill down on multiple industries and segments and compare and see how you're doing against the marketing industry as a whole versus legal, versus tech, versus development. So that could be an advanced feature that you could change the NAIC benchmark comparison code, but you can't do that on the free one. The free one, you just get to see. your industry and the global. Or maybe you're just so global and not even your industry, you know?
Andrej
Yeah.
Mike Schwarz
But my thought's like, how we protect in the long run versus, like, anyone can pop open this code and rip this thing off, it's gonna be the data that we collect, soâ€¦ I'm hoping to raise a bunch of money to put towards marketing, and if I can be spending, like. tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. on paid marketing. collecting a massive data set. then the vision for, like, version 2 or 3. is exciting, like, think whereâ€¦ I want to see how I'm benchmarking against. social mediaâ€¦ agencies in the United States that have between 10 and 25 employees.
Andrej
Yeah, okay. Uh, I guess theâ€¦ two big questions I have isâ€¦ They'll, you know, not questions, but to requirements that I'll need in order to.
Mike Schwarz
this is how I'm doing. That kind of level of granularity, I think it's going to be super valuable.
Andrej
put forward a specific plan would beâ€¦ Uh, number one, toâ€¦ to haveâ€¦ more exact list of what you're looking for from. marketing analytics perspective. I can come up with some basics in terms of, you know, somebody registering an account, somebody logged in, somebody. you know, went through the assessment and stuff like that. But is there more that you're looking for? Any sort of, like, conversion rate pixels that need to be implemented somewhere, stuff like that? I wouldn't use analytics for you, just, you know, I would useâ€¦ Unless you have a requirement for some sort of analytics integration, butâ€¦ PostHog is exceptionally well done for that, and recently I've been kind of more and more leaning towards just building it internally, because all of the data is internal, like, when somebody logged in, when somebody registered, when theyâ€¦ you know, when they completed their first survey, all of that data is native to the database, and.
Um, and uhâ€¦ and it's easy toâ€¦ extract into a dashboard. Um, but without knowing exactly what you want, like, in terms ofâ€¦ Trackability of conversions and how people are interacting with you.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, okay, so I've added a task. to get you a list of the analytics requirements. There'll be some best practices I'll get from. ChatGPT, and then I'll include my personal wishlist, and I'll get you that. Um, what else do you need from me?
Andrej
Yeah. And then you did say that you can pretty quickly snap up your, you know. some sort of version of the output that would be applicable, at least so that we know some sort of a skeleton. Like, you mentioned 8â€¦ chapters or something like that, like, if you can work with AI to. And would, you know, give it a context of your book, and tell it how to generate these 8 chapters, and so we can just see a roughâ€¦ It doesn't need to be, like, this is exactly what the PDF is going to look like, it could just be, like, these are the sections we're gonna have.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah. Yeah, I've alreadyâ€¦ Yeah.
Andrej
So that there's, like, a bit of a visual of the architecture of that. output.
Mike Schwarz
I've got those rough pillars. Another one I'm thinking here is get, uhâ€¦ Mario slash Dennis. to, you know, mock up. the, you know, cover pageâ€¦ slash introâ€¦ to the, like, the rapper. The rapper, the firstâ€¦ 1 to 5 pages of theâ€¦ thing, and the final pageâ€¦ So this whole thing gets wrapped professionally.
Andrej
What about the ability to redo the assessment? Like, is thereâ€¦ I see that I can now do, let's say. 5 completions on Q2 2025 assessment. Um. I don't see that tracking progress is yet completed, it's blurred out in theâ€¦ in the sidebar, so is that something that you need for MVP, like a comparability between. Different assessments. Like, if they run it twice.
Mike Schwarz
Oh, they already have comparability. Um, what are the ideaâ€¦ Decon Wright is that they would complete it once every quarter, so they would. So then we would send them an email notification that says, hey, Andre, the Q4. assessment is ready. for you to complete, and then they would complete it, and then that would just beâ€¦ we would log the data points from the previous. one, and compare that as part of theâ€¦ data that we feed into the prompt. So, when we're getting recommendations on the chapter, we can say, like, if theyâ€¦ have data from the previous quarter, then you can say, like, you've made great progress here, here, and here. We didn't see any improvement here.
Andrej
Yeah.
Mike Schwarz
Um, you know, this is the recommended strategy for you, and then based on their lack of progress in a specific area, that might trigger something under education, or accountability, or coaching, and say, hey, weâ€¦ We now highly recommend that you have an accountability coach. Uh, because we can see that. blah blah blah. So, the data from previous ones will be incorporated into the report for future ones, and we already.
Andrej
Mm-hmm.
Mike Schwarz
show that. But again, like Bikan said.
Andrej
Do weâ€¦ do we pre-schedule these quarterly ones? Like, if they log in now, complete one, do weâ€¦ automatically schedule 3 or 4 more for the following 3 quarters.
Mike Schwarz
No, we haven't done that yet. We haven't doneâ€¦ No, Iâ€¦ no, I think weâ€¦ whatâ€¦ We have 3 months after launch of MVP to figure that out, you know?
Andrej
So thatâ€¦ so that emails go out, like. Now, I know, I know, but is that an MVP, like, requirement? Do we send them emails?
Mike Schwarz
So I think we canâ€¦ we canâ€¦ we can wait, but that should be coming pretty soon after, like, within 3 months of marketing this.
Andrej
Okay. what I'm scared is that they're gonna manually go through more than one, because right now I can run. as many up to 5 as I want, right? I'm logged in, I have been allocated 5 assessments, and I can just run them, like, every week, and, you know, burn themâ€¦ burn through them, andâ€¦ and then I'm not clear that these are quarterly.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, making it clear that their quarterly assessments, I think, can be communicated through the homepage and just through some updated text, but I think that's important to say this is a quarterly assessment, and maybe, like, if we're worried about tokens, like, if building that 80-page.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
Doc is costing us money, and we're getting thousands of people doing it. then we might need to say that you can only do it once, and maybe you canâ€¦
Andrej
I'm not worried about it at all. Like, honestly. tokens for that are just gonna be, like, pennies.
Mike Schwarz
Okay, soâ€¦
Andrej
Not pennies, but, you know, likeâ€¦ have aâ€¦ That entire book's gonna beâ€¦ 10 cents type of a thing, I think. Well, even if it's 10, 20 cents, you have a thousand people, that's 200 bucks, but 1,000 people gives you so much exposure, 200 bucks probably doesn't matter, even if it is. 200 bucks, like, there'sâ€¦ you know, on ReCapio, for example, I'm processingâ€¦ thousands of videos every day, and for each, I'm generating a summary.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
And I'm paying, like, 200 bucks a month, type of thing.
Mike Schwarz
Okay, okay. Soâ€¦ Well, whyâ€¦ why are you concerned if somebodyâ€¦ like, right now, it allows them to come back and do the same report up to 5 times? Are you just worried they're going to extract too much value from. I don't think anyone'sâ€¦
Andrej
No, not too much value, they're gonna beâ€¦ it's gonna be useless for them to complete the survey, you know, now, and then. It's just notâ€¦ like, from your perspective, right now, it's just not clear. to me that, like, if I'm clicking on Start New Assessment, I'm like, ah, maybe I'll just do once again to see how I do now. I do see that it's one of the five completions used. But, you know, why not? Like, I don't have anything to tell me right now. that I cannot run a new assessment because I already have. Generaâ€¦ like, this can actually be easily solved by putting a limit into place where. They cannot even run the new assessment of the same type.
If they have ran one, like, in the last 30 days, 60 days, or something like that.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, I think that makes sense. Like, itâ€¦
Andrej
Because nothing prevents you from, like, literally clicking start assessment right now and going through the second one, you know?
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, this is from EOS. entrepreneurial operating system has that rule where you complete that assessment once every quarter, it's part of the Rockefeller Habits, too. They do the same thing. So, yeah, refining that, but that might be a version 1.1. It sounds like a nice-to-have. Yes, we definitely want it, but. You know, right now, I just want to get people coming and completing the assessment once. I agree it's important to set their expectations that this is something that they have to come back and complete quarterly. The mechanics of how we do that, I think.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
could potentially be sorted out later, but if it's easy to slot in there. then, yeah, I would like to make itâ€¦ like, maybe limit them to complete one, maybe they can just edit the one. And that's fine, and it's locked in, that this is theirâ€¦ October, November. This is, like, their Q4 2025 readiness assessment, and then we let them know when the Q1 2026 is ready.
Andrej
Uh, sorry. Logistics kids.
Mike Schwarz
Were there any more, uh, features that you think need to be fixed or worked on? Besides, like, the NAIC code. uh, granularity and roll-up based on statistical significance. The more beautifulâ€¦ customized report with that knowledge base admin panel, analytics package. Is there any other business requirements that you think. we need here? Yes.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Oh, yeah, the PDF generation, like Andre mentioned, it's bugged right now. So, we need to look into that.
Mike Schwarz
Not the how, or the what, or the code, or the architecture, or the bugs, but features, like business requirements.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Ah, you meanâ€¦ the prompt for generating the PDF. Right now, it's pretty basic, soâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, we had that one already, so we needâ€¦ we need an admin panel where I can edit the prompts, and we have different prompts for each section. So that's on there, that's a requirement. Anything else that we think we need?
Bican Marian Valeriu
No, that'sâ€¦ You've covered pretty much everything.
Mike Schwarz
Okay, and if that's enough for a feature set for V1, like, I'm pretty comfortable. With that, Iâ€¦ I'm happy toâ€¦ start marketing that, collect some data, look at the analytics. talk to, you know, get our existing clients to do it, do it with them, andâ€¦ And then based on that, refineâ€¦ version 2. Do you think we should start looking at version 2 features now, Andre, or is that for later?
Andrej
Um, no, I think we canâ€¦ go through more details of. version 1 features I can put together aâ€¦ you know, what gets us to MVP. Umâ€¦ We do have a list of features for versionâ€¦ to in the document, so there's a, you know, there's an idea of what could be built, but technically speaking, it's completely irrelevant, like, you know. talking about it now is not going to change what we need to do in the following weeks.
Does that make sense?
Mike Schwarz
Okay, so there's no, likeâ€¦ I don't see anyâ€¦ Well, the architecturalâ€¦ strategy needs to include e-commerce for paid, it needs to include the ability to have those three layers of a company and a paid company account. Um, and that we need the ability to start to customize these surveys by industry and department and. And, uh. That's pretty much it.
Andrej
Yeah. I, I don'tâ€¦ I don't even think about it as version 2, I think about that asâ€¦ continual rollouts of what makes sense to roll out next, in a sense, right?
Mike Schwarz
Yep. Okay. All right.
Andrej
Soâ€¦ Uh, yeah, I wouldâ€¦ I wouldâ€¦ I would put together a document based on what we talked about right now, in terms of what is it going to take to get us to MVP. And that's the starting point, and everything else can then just, you know. You know, if that's something we're gonna go and execute, then while executing the road to MVP, we can start. mapping out what the other features look like once live. It's probably going to be a little bit of time when weâ€¦ You know, at the point of launch, there's probably going to be some time you want to pause, like, uh, you know, even if it's a week or two when.
you push some people into it and, you know, listen to their feedback, andâ€¦ polish the MVP before keeping adding a lot of other stuff.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah. Oh, I just thought one of one's really small feature for MVP is we need the ability toâ€¦ Uh, with maybe that analytics package, like, we need to be able to query and download, like. show meâ€¦ give me a name, email, company for everybody who'sâ€¦ signed up from these types of industries, like all the law firms, or all the marketers, marketing agencies, being able to filter and download. So that I can do drip email to them. the future, we'll have the email communication probably built right into the platform, but, um, for now, I just need the abilityâ€¦ Because there's already hundreds of people that have filled this thing out.
Andrej
Well. I wouldâ€¦ I would do that differently. I would integrate you with, uh, Brevo, or ifâ€¦ If you prefer any otherâ€¦ transaction and marketing email platform, but Brevo, in my experience, is really, really good.
Bican Marian Valeriu
users.
Mike Schwarz
Yes. I think it does, because MVP, we're going to be tracking retention rates, andâ€¦ Um, yeah, you're right, it might beâ€¦ It's not afterâ€¦ because retentionâ€¦ that will come getting people to make sure they complete.
Andrej
Um, and so, yes, maybe you can have, you knowâ€¦ the export function is not a problem, but also automatically putting them into. Um, into lists within Brevo. Uh, having automations, like, you know, 7 days after sign-up. 14 days after sign up, if they complete it, not completed. Uh, that's something that architecturally would be valuable to. think aboutâ€¦ it doesn't, again, need to be a part of MVP, because youâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
theâ€¦ following quarter one. But yeah, I, like, you know, like, if I was building an e-commerce store and I didn't have, like, a shopping cart abandonment email, like. It's gonna affect the success of the whole product. So, yeah, it might be something we get in there pretty quick.
Andrej
Yeah, you might want to have some sort of basic implementation first, in terms of. anybody who signs up is generated. in Brevo, as just added to a basic list, like, you know. And then anybody who completes an assessment is added, uhâ€¦ into Brevoice assessment completed, and then, you know, that's probably it, as far as you need now, and then you can just set up a basic one in terms of, like, hey, we see you're registered. And you haven't yet completed your assessment, it's been 2 days. Right? Or, hey, we see new registered, and, you know, orâ€¦ whatever else. Soâ€¦ that's as far as you need, I think, for MVP.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah. Yeah.
Andrej
My experience with these, like, automated transactional emails, they bring you very, very, very little. Like, it'sâ€¦ if you sign up a thousand people and they don't complete the assessment, and then you send them an email, it's just gonna make. not much of a difference, obviously. It's gonna getâ€¦ One more, like, out of a thousand, like, 0.1%.
Mike Schwarz
Well, but it'sâ€¦ it'sâ€¦ For me, it'sâ€¦ it'sâ€¦ It's huge branding. I think I want that pretty soon, because I would do things likeâ€¦ well, one, of course, if they don't complete the assessment, getting them to complete it will help. Butâ€¦ after they've completed it, you know, the thank you and the follow-up and, you know, checking in with them andâ€¦ you know, reminding them about the propaganda, like, how are you doing? Have you found a fractional CAO yet? This is why it's important. Reminder from this chapter. Here's the new best practice, like.

ðŸ’¡
Callout
I'm gonna start to build out some pretty sophisticated marketing journeys behind these. to get conversions to our affiliates and ourselves, so that's where I think it's gonna be more exciting. So I would put that in aâ€¦ pretty high up the list, yeah.
Andrej
Yeah. MVP, yeah. Okay. Yeah, umâ€¦ from technical integration with Braille perspective, again, they either signed up or not, and if they signed up, they're in the list.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah.
Andrej
then it'sâ€¦ they either completed the assessment or not, and if they did, they're in aâ€¦ Um, uhâ€¦ what are those calls? Like, buckets, or whatever that, you know, which you define, and. And it's, you know, assessment completed. Our first assessment completed bucket. And then it's up to you in Brevo how do youâ€¦ how do you market to them if it's 3 days, 7 days, once in a while, create a custom. Like, you mightâ€¦ may have, like, a custom piece of content that you suddenly release and publish on a blog.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah.
Andrej
Uh, which, by the way, I don't think we mentioned, but will this thing have a blog?
Mike Schwarz
Uh, yeah.
Andrej
Do you need to be able toâ€¦ create, object, manage, edit the blog.
Mike Schwarz
Uh, not for version 1, but yeah, I mean, we should already have a blog on MyZone. AI website, and this is part of that website.
Andrej
Yeah. Yeah, honestly, like, I'm now just building blogs into custom platforms very, very easily, and I like that because it's interconnected. You can programmatically have things inserted into blog.
Mike Schwarz
This is just the readiness assessment, and then there'll be a blog as part of that site.
Andrej
Like, for example, if you want to have. Um, uh, you know. Well, maybe not aâ€¦ maybe not for now, but once you get down to theâ€¦ having all sorts of different types of, umâ€¦ different questions on different levels, including personal ones, and so on and so forth. Just having a blog completely somewhere else, like on a WordPress site or whatever. Uh, just decouples yourâ€¦ all of your data and logic, like, for example, you know, one blog article you may want to release on a cadence level, like, let's say monthly or quarterly, or even weekly, might be. here's the, you know, the report of all the readiness, like, you know, obfuscated readiness assessment data across multiple industries.
Um, and you can auto-generate that to go out, let's say, every month. Like, for example, right?
Mike Schwarz
Well, Iâ€¦ I thinkâ€¦ but I think that's gonna be tied, likeâ€¦ tied in with MyZone AI.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Yeah.
Mike Schwarz
Right? This is all connected. So, yes, I want all that, but I think that's part of my zoneâ€¦ dot AI slash blog.
Andrej
Okay, yeah, look, ifâ€¦
Bican Marian Valeriu
Mike, mic, Mike. I agree with Andrew on this one.
Mike Schwarz
Yeah.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Andre is trying to say that you can use the data in the backend that you have. And generate those blocks on the fly, soâ€¦ You can do it so much easier now withâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, no, and I want all that, no question that I want it, but I just think, like, where it lives, I want those blog articles to be featured on the homepage of MyZone.ai.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Thisâ€¦
Andrej
Huh. Okay.
Mike Schwarz
Right? Because this is what we're doing, like, this isâ€¦ This is a KPI for the entire program. this is ev- like, this isâ€¦ This isâ€¦
Andrej
I would honestly think that if you're choosing to go with. branding this as a separate brand, andâ€¦ you know, build that out, and umâ€¦ part of it is on flight. on Flight Director, you also want to have.
Mike Schwarz
Oh, this is not aâ€¦ this is not a separate brand. This isâ€¦ this is still MyZone AI. This isâ€¦ the product, I think we'll probably call it Flight Navigator, not Readiness Assessment. It's your guide to flying. learn to crawl, we say crawl, walk, run. fly with AI. This is your navigator that takes you down that path, and all the coaching and everything that we do is connected to this.
Andrej
Yep.
Mike Schwarz
And that, like, if we get a bunch of data that comes out of this, and we want to dynamically feature blog articles, I'm just saying those should be. part of the Mies on AI newsletter. Like, this is all one product, MyZone AI.
Andrej
Okay. So, so where's the URL gonna be on this? Is itâ€¦ FlightNavigator.meizen.ai, orâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah. This, uh, curâ€¦ currently is ready.myzone.ai. Um, weâ€¦ Uh, well, if weâ€¦ what do youâ€¦ do you guys prefer Flight Navigator? Iâ€¦ I think I do. Readiness assessment's a mouthful.
Andrej
That's where it's gonna stay, orâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
assessment is hard to say. Flight Navigator. isâ€¦ easier. It's more memorable.
Bican Marian Valeriu
To be honest, I prefer this already in my zone.ai.
Mike Schwarz
And it alignsâ€¦
Bican Marian Valeriu
It's easy to remember, andâ€¦
Andrej
Yeah, I'm in a totally different camp, Iâ€¦ You know my position on that, and it's completely opposite of yours, andâ€¦ I would just build this out as a separate product and call it Flight Navigator, or whatever you choose, and not even tie it to my zone in that sense, but tie it with. Maison sense that Maison is a provider of all these services, and aâ€¦ parent company to this product, but, umâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, well, the reason I would keep it a house of brands, or a branded house, like, is because the customers are identical between. Mize on AI and the readiness assessment. It's 100% identical, so it should be, like, the Apple AirPods, the Apple iPhone, the Apple this, not likeâ€¦ something new.
Andrej
That's fine, that's fine, we don't have to debate that at all, like, it's your choice, andâ€¦ I, you know, you were just askingâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, no, I'm clear, and Iâ€¦ I'm clear, but I think it could be called. to MyZone AI Flight Navigator, as opposed to MyZone AI Readiness Assessment. But Readiness Assessment tells people what it is. Right? It's more descriptive, but Flight Navigator, I think, is a little bit cooler sounding.
Bican Marian Valeriu
For me, it's not, to be honest. It sounds more like a flight. company, to be honest. just my boss.
Andrej
If you'reâ€¦ if you're keeping it within the same brand, I would go forâ€¦ for readiness assessment, because. It's alreadyâ€¦ confâ€¦ you know, youâ€¦ there's already a level of confusion, because you'reâ€¦ in ready.mizonai, so now I have to know what's my zone, and what's ready. And so if you're confusing people even further, so it's like, I don't know what's Maison yet, but okay, I get it, I get that, but now there's some sort of flight estimator that doesn't evenâ€¦ You know, like, this is whereâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, okay.
Andrej
misinter chatbots, right? It's not like Myzenaiâ€¦ Grok something, right? It'sâ€¦ it's, it's like there's a very specificâ€¦ This is what it is, man, like, you know, we're Maison, we have chatbots, we have readiness assessment, we have this, this, and that, andâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah, I'mâ€¦ yeah, let'sâ€¦ let's keep it simple.
Andrej
you know, that'sâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, let's keep it simple. I've already branded it to thousands of people as a readiness assessment, and it is known in the industry as an AI readiness assessment, and there's other competitors. Like, when McKinsey launches this, they talk about the McKinsey AI Readiness Assessment. Uh, there's SEO value to being a readiness assessment app. So let's keep it readiness assessment, it'll keep it at that domain, ready.myzone.ai. For now, and we can always look at rebranding. in the future, and that could be part of a discussion, too, when we raise a bunch of money and we want to do marketing, we can do some A-B testing and see what works best.
Andrej
Yeah. Okay, uh, I already have a list, I went through the code, I already have a list of things that would need to be done, uh, forâ€¦ MVP to go live, and some of them are, you know, security-related, architecture-related, and it went with, like, minimum viable. viable. Like, for example, we don't need a bunch of unit tests at this point, or integration tests. But, uh, we absolutely need, like, JWT tokens not stored in local storage, because that's a major security concern. For example, right? And there's 6 or 7 things that would need to be done.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Yeah.
Andrej
Um, I've been doing that forâ€¦ 3 or 4 different projects already, and I don't think it's a big deal, like, we can do it in a few days. Umâ€¦ I alreadyâ€¦ I already created a file that just outlines everything that needs to be done, and would go through.
Mike Schwarz
Okay. Umâ€¦
Andrej
you know, one at a time, andâ€¦ That's it.
Mike Schwarz
And howâ€¦ how do you want to align withâ€¦ with BCAN onâ€¦ architecture, because he's working on a new architecture on this test project he's doing on the side, and. learningâ€¦ do you guys just want toâ€¦ connect, because I think one of the big values here is, like, you guys, uh, connecting and aligning on that.
Andrej
I'm not sure yet, um, you know, the way I would start working on this is just, uhâ€¦ heads down, dive in, and start generating stuff. Uh, but if Beacon is, uh. you know, doing the work, thenâ€¦ I don't know, we'd have toâ€¦ we'd have toâ€¦ we'd have to go on a call and see whatâ€¦ where we canâ€¦ where you're at, beacon with. What's your approach to AIGN decoding first and foremost? Because. There'sâ€¦ there are specific workflows that I have that are very, very, very optimal. Umâ€¦ And then we, you know, we have to figure out, Mike, in terms ofâ€¦ Uh, who's doing what on the project. Uh, we can cross the bridge, I can just, preliminary just jump on a call with Beacon, you know, sometime this week, and figure out.
how far Beacon did you come along with learning agent decoding, and generally speaking, the architecture.
Bican Marian Valeriu
I wouldâ€¦ I will let you take the lead on this, because you have more experience than me.
Andrej
Uh, that'sâ€¦ nope.
Bican Marian Valeriu
And, to be honest, even though I've learned a lot on this, maybe I went on a different path than yours, soâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Yeah, well, let'sâ€¦ letâ€¦ let'sâ€¦ Well, I'm just keeping it on a list of, like.
Andrej
So what you're suggesting, actually? I'm not clear.
Mike Schwarz
Soâ€¦ Well, yeah. For sure.
Bican Marian Valeriu
You decide how things can be done regarding the backend architecture andâ€¦
Andrej
No, I'll decide, yeah, for sure, I'll decide how things will be done. I'm just starting to figure out how you fit in, like, what are you gonnaâ€¦
Mike Schwarz
Like, how do we synergize between the two of you?
Bican Marian Valeriu
I don't know, I'm fine with whatever you guysâ€¦ one soul. I don't mind, I like to work with Andres, soâ€¦ If that's what you are asking.
Mike Schwarz
So, we'll just leave it withâ€¦ leave it with you, Andre, to decide, uh, how Bacon plugs in as a resource, and where his skills are at. Does he need to go.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Yeah, yeah.
Mike Schwarz
back and do more training on things, or is he ready to jump in and add value? And so, yeah, like, Andre, you take the lead, andâ€¦
Andrej
So, Bikin, I mean, we can jump on a call tomorrow morning, I can give you a quick test.

ðŸŽ¯
Decision
And really, it's just gonna beâ€¦ I can show you all of my workflows, and I can give you a document that I already created for. refactoring that we need to do, and we can take just one part of it, just, let's say, let's say implementing consistent API responses. as just one, you know, because you have API responses that are all over the place, they're not standardized right now.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Yeah.
Andrej
Right? You need to have, like, a proper success error data, uh, metadata, and whatever you want to put into there, you know, there are certain. known standards, and we just gotta go through every single API endpoint that exists, andâ€¦ create a standard, and then bridge over what currently exists. both from the Beckon perspective, and then, you know, customized front-end to meetâ€¦ to properly process the backend response. That's it. Um, and justâ€¦ I can show you how I would do it.
Bican Marian Valeriu
I can't even show you directly what I already did on the other project, soâ€¦ because I already did that.
Andrej
That's irrelevant to me. What's relevant is, how are you gonna now do this on this project, right? How are you gonnaâ€¦ How are you going to basically take, this is what we have, this is what it needs to be, and how you're going to be, you know.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Ah, okay, okay.
Andrej
what amount of time you'll need, and how you're going to approach. translating it forâ€¦ and I'll coach you as much as I can, like, you know, from. you know, current to ideal, right? And we can start there, and then we can figure it out. Okay.
Mike Schwarz
Okay, guys, uhâ€¦ Uh, excellent first meeting. We'll get this, uh, transcript posted in the Slack channel for this. We'll let you guys take it from here offline. I got a client call, it starts in one minute. I gotta prep for. But, yeah, I'm excited to kick this thing off, andâ€¦ Yeah, thank you so much for everyone's time, and we'll talk soon.
Bican Marian Valeriu
Okay, guys. Bye-bye.
Andrej
Okay, sounds good. Thank you, babe.
Mike Schwarz
Thanks, guys.
