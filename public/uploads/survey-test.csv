1,Strategy & Vision,Our Vision / 3-year picture / 1-year plan explicitly considers an AGI future.,"A forward-looking vision isn't just a slogan—it sets the mental horizon that informs every budget, hire, and product decision. Explicitly acknowledging the possibility of Artificial General Intelligence forces a small business to think beyond today's tools and imagine scenarios where creative reasoning, not just task automation, is widely available. This mindset helps leadership spot long-tail risks (e.g., entire offerings becoming commodities overnight) and opportunity gaps (bundling human service with AGI speed). By discussing AGI in the same breath as revenue targets and market share, you teach the team to "build for antifragility," selecting vendors, data models, and processes that can evolve quickly as capabilities compound. It also signals to staff and investors that the firm is intentional, not reactive, about technological upheaval."
2,Strategy & Vision,"The company sets at least one corporate AI Rock each quarter, with a measurable outcome.","Rocks (in EOS parlance) create focus and accountability. A single, high-impact AI Rock every quarter—e.g., "Automate invoice coding to recover 15 hours/month"—prevents the common pitfall of spreading effort across too many pilots. The measurable outcome forces clarity on scope, owner, timeline, and success metric, turning AI from "initiative" to concrete business improvement. Over successive quarters these Rocks compound, building muscle memory around scoping, resourcing, and de-risking AI work. The cadence also surfaces blockers early (budget, data access, training) so leadership can unblock quickly rather than letting enthusiasm fizzle. In short, one Rock per quarter keeps AI strategic but bite-sized—perfect for smaller teams that can't absorb multiple concurrent moonshots."
