## 🧭 Strategy & Vision

MyZone AI Ltd’s score of 5/10 indicates that strategy and vision for AI are developing but lack depth and consistency. While quarterly AI Rocks and ICP reviews are in place, there are significant gaps: AGI scenarios and benchmarking against competitors are not fully addressed, and AI KPIs are missing from the scorecard. This mixed foundation risks leaving the company behind more proactive competitors. Immediate focus should be on formalizing the vision and embedding AI metrics throughout strategic planning.

**How You Performed**

* **Current Score:** 5 / 10 (50%)
* **Trend vs. Previous:** First-time assessment

**🗝️ Key Best Practices**
1. Explicitly include AGI scenarios and AI KPIs in annual and quarterly strategy.
2. Benchmark AI ambitions against competitors annually.
3. Add AI objectives and metrics to leadership scorecards.

## 🌱 Culture & Change-Readiness

A score of 6.5/10 suggests reasonable openness to AI change but reveals fragility in ongoing engagement. Staff feel safe proposing automation ideas and AI-aligned values are present, but celebration of wins and clarity in communication plans are lacking. Automated feedback loops exist but aren’t fully optimized. To boost readiness, celebrate AI wins widely, reinforce communication, and deepen visible leadership support.

**How You Performed**

* **Current Score:** 6.5 / 10 (65%)
* **Trend vs. Previous:** First-time assessment

**🗝️ Key Best Practices**
1. Publicly celebrate AI and automation wins to reinforce momentum.
2. Ensure every tech change follows a clear, simple communication plan.
3. Embed AI-aligned values into onboarding and daily discussions.

## 📚 Skills & Literacy

With a 4.5/10, skills and literacy are critical weaknesses. While AI literacy assessments and some training occur, there’s a lack of consistency: not all staff set AI learning goals, onboarding lacks AI, and few AI Champions are named. The absence of a senior AI advisor further undermines progress. Prioritize structured role-based AI education, appoint AI Champions per department, and provide ongoing access to expert guidance.

**How You Performed**

* **Current Score:** 4.5 / 10 (45%)
* **Trend vs. Previous:** First-time assessment

**🗝️ Key Best Practices**
1. Assign an AI Champion in every department.
2. Embed AI literacy training into onboarding and ongoing learning.
3. Secure access to a senior AI advisor (in-house or fractional).

## 🗄️ Data & Information

Scoring 5/10, MyZone AI Ltd has made progress with a Data Champion and some centralization, but foundational weaknesses remain. Data enrichment and consistent metadata tagging are missing, and the data strategy is not regularly reviewed. Many files lack standardized searchability, risking future process automation and analytics. Urgently standardize metadata/tagging, enrich first-party data, and formalize quarterly data strategy reviews.

**How You Performed**

* **Current Score:** 5 / 10 (50%)
* **Trend vs. Previous:** First-time assessment

**🗝️ Key Best Practices**
1. Standardize metadata/tags across all files and records.
2. Enrich first-party data systematically for better AI and analytics outcomes.
3. Review and update the data strategy quarterly.

## 🤖 Technology & Integration

A low score of 1.9/10 signals urgent risk: core tools lack AI readiness, few APIs or integrations exist, and communication data is not organized for future AI search. There is no established integration platform, and vendor management is weak. Immediate corrective action is needed—modernize toolsets, prioritize API-enabled platforms, and deploy an integration platform (Make/n8n) to enable automation.

**How You Performed**

* **Current Score:** 1.9 / 10 (19%)
* **Trend vs. Previous:** First-time assessment

**🗝️ Key Best Practices**
1. Transition to cloud-based, API-enabled, AI-ready core tools.
2. Deploy an integration platform (e.g., Make or n8n) for process hand-offs.
3. Organize company communications in searchable, project-mirrored channels.

## ⚙️ Process & Operations

At 6.5/10, process and operations show solid groundwork. Key processes are mapped with pain points flagged, and prioritization for automation is underway. However, measurement of baseline metrics is inconsistent and AI discussions are not a regular part of meetings. To maximize ROI, improve baseline tracking and make AI process improvement a standing agenda item in strategic meetings.

**How You Performed**

* **Current Score:** 6.5 / 10 (65%)
* **Trend vs. Previous:** First-time assessment

**🗝️ Key Best Practices**
1. Capture baseline metrics (time, cost, errors) before process changes.
2. Make AI opportunities/process improvement a regular meeting topic.
3. Maintain a prioritized automation matrix for decision-making.

## 🛡️ Governance, Ethics & Risk

A 7/10 score reflects strong foundational governance. Policies address privacy and bias, audit trails and incident plans are in place, and cross-functional oversight exists. However, compliance can be improved and governance should be reviewed more frequently. Strengthen compliance training and ensure regular (at least quarterly) governance team check-ins for evolving risks.

**How You Performed**

* **Current Score:** 7 / 10 (70%)
* **Trend vs. Previous:** First-time assessment

**🗝️ Key Best Practices**
1. Review and update AI/data governance policies quarterly.
2. Maintain a cross-functional governance team with regular meetings.
3. Ensure compliance (GDPR/CCPA/etc.) is monitored and documented.

## 💰 Financial & Resources

At 2.5/10, financial support for AI is a critical weakness. There is no dedicated AI budget, little tracking of available grants or credits, and TCO checks are rare. This threatens the sustainability of all AI and automation efforts. Establish an AI budget line, conduct TCO analyses before initiatives, and proactively apply for relevant grants or credits.

**How You Performed**

* **Current Score:** 2.5 / 10 (25%)
* **Trend vs. Previous:** First-time assessment

**🗝️ Key Best Practices**
1. Create a dedicated AI budget for tools, training, and advisory.
2. Track and apply for government AI grants or credits.
3. Run TCO analyses before approving new AI investments.
